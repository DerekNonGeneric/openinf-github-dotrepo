## Support[^1]

Having trouble? Please consult these official resources in order of appearance.

### Resources

**[open.inf.is][docs-site] on the Web:** The OpenINF website. It has docs and
tutorial resources.

**[`#openinf`][matrix-channel] on matrix.org:** The OpenINF Matrix support
channel on the _matrix.org_ network. It’s a synchronous chat channel for
lightweight communication. It is good for asking questions, casual
conversation, collaboration, and quick exchanges. Be sure to follow our [Code of
Conduct][coc]. The room is end-to-end encrypted, and you will need first to be
verified before messages can be seen (this is performed by in-room mods/admins).
Invitation to the space would have to happen before room verification can occur,
but this channel is now mostly defunct in favor of our Discord channel(s).

**[`#support`][discord-support-channel] in OpenINF Community Server Discord:** The
[`#support` channel][] on the OpenINF Community Server Discord. It’s a lightly-managed
synchronous chat channel for providing yet-another communication venue. It is good
for asking questions (the only dumb questions are those not asked). Casual conversation,
collaboration, and/or any other quick exchanges would more appropriately occur in our
[`#general` channel][].

However, the core membership of the OpenINF Community does not congregate here
(or any other chat platform, for that matter). Even after several years of trial
and error, from a single channel on the freenode IRC network to an entire
Mastodon node in the Fediverse, there has yet to be a solution to furnish the
unique needs of our ever-evolving community. Simply put, we have found nothing
that feels quite right for very long, so don't get too comfortable. This Discord
Server we speak of will likely be next as our core membership's interest has not
only remained relatively flat but is on a rather steep decline lately. If it's
urgent, email us.

Please use the [`#off-topic` channel][] for any other side
<abbr title="conversations">convos</abbr> that may need to take place. Be sure
to follow our [Code of Conduct][coc].

**[@OpenINF][x-twitter-account] on X (formerly Twitter):** The OpenINF Community
support account on X (formerly Twitter).
<abbr title="Direct Messages">DMs</abbr> (Direct Messages) remain open at all
times. Be sure to follow the new [X Rules][x-twitter-rules] (formerly Twitter
Rules) _and_ our [Code of Conduct][coc].
